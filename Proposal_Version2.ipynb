    "Various factors can play a significant role in a student’s knowledge level. Understanding the attributes that contribute to knowledge levels can help improve a student’s academic success. In this project, the following question will be answered: what is the predicted knowledge level of a user given their degree of study time for goal object materials (STG) and the exam performance of the user for goal objects (PEG)?\n",

    "This project utilizes the User Knowledge Modeling Dataset to predict the knowledge level of a user (UNS) through creating a classification model using the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. This dataset examines a group of student’s knowledge pertaining to the subject of Electrical DC machines. The knowledge level of a user can be classified as “Very Low”, “Low” , “Middle”, and “High”.

We will visualize the results by creating a scatterplot, labelling the x-axis as the degree of study time goal object materials (STG) and y-axis as the exam performance of user for goal objects (PEG). By doing so, we will be able to visualize the relationship between STG and PEG. Then we will use the K-nearest neighbors classification algorithm to predict the knowledge level of user (UNS). With this classifier, we will find the K “nearest” observations from the training data set."
